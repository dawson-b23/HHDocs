# Work Materials — Index

This page summarizes the `Work/` folder contents and links to focused pages documenting the major project components created during the internship.

Pages:
- Defects: `docs/defects.md` (completed)
- Data descriptions: `docs/data-descriptions.md` (completed)
- LLM notes: `docs/llm-notes.md` (completed)

Project folders to document (in progress):
- `Work/projects/opcua_for_presses` → `docs/opcua_for_presses.md`
- `Work/projects/data_display` → `docs/data_display.md`
- `Work/projects/fault_collection_app` → `docs/fault_collection_app.md`

I will create detailed pages for these project folders next, documenting: purpose, how to run scripts, ingestion pathways, important files, and recommendations for next steps. If there are other specific folders you want prioritized, tell me now.
