# Upgrade Path

This is the list of upgrades and changes I would suggest for the future, if that is of interest.

## 1. Model Upgrades
Right now (August 2025) the project is using the `gpt-oss:20b` model, which is fine for most things, but eventually, there will need to be an upgrade to a more powerful model. I would recommend targetting the 70b llama models or the `gpt-oss:120b` model (which is very good, high functioning, and well recieved in the community). 

### 1.1 GPU
- This is the most important upgrade, as it will allow for much more powerful models to be used.
- Righ now, the system has a nice gpu, but it only supports 24gb of VRAM. The gpt-oss:120b model requires a minimum of 80gb of VRAM
  - This is a MINIMUM requirement, and I would recommend a minimum of about 90+ gb of VRAM
### 1.2 CPU
- This is fine as is 
- Only need to look to upgrade this if you need to be able to run a lot more software concurrently.
### 1.3 LLM 
- LIke I said above, the models I would recommend are:
  - 70b llama models
  - `gpt-oss:120b` model.
  - Any other large model that is trained to follow instructions.
  - A note here, if you end up liking another model, you can get into fine-tuning it to fit your needs better (very demanding and somewhat complicated as a heads up)
