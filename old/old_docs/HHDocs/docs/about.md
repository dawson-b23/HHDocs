## Intern 
Hello! My name is Dawson Burgess and I am a summer intern for H&H Molds Inc.
I am a software programmer with an undergraduate degress in computer science, 
Master's degree in computer science with an emphasis in Industrial Robotics, 
and am actively pursuing a Doctorate in Intelligent Industrial Robotics all through 
the University of Idaho! 

This summer internship, I was tasked with spearheading the development of a custom local 
AI system. The goal of this system is to serve as a tool for setup technicians to help 
improve the process for a customer by being able to provide troubleshooting/support,
and reduce overall scrap.

## Company 
H&H Molds is a full service mold-making and injection molding company providing 
total plastics services to a growing list of industries, including electronics, 
telecommunications, medical, pharmaceutical, sports, utilities, agricultural, 
food and dairy.

H&H Molds Inc. is committed to advancing the injection molding opportunities for smaller 
companies looking to break into the market. Their innovation and adaption to new technologies
is what birthed this summer internship, and helps bring reliable production to their customers.
